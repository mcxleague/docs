You can self-host vercl.co on your own servers and cloud infrastructure for greater control over your data and design. This guide will walk you through the entire process of setting up vercl.co on your own servers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
- A [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) account
- A [Resend](https://resend.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account

## Step 1: Local setup

First, clone the [Vercl.co repo](https://dub.sh/github) into a public GitHub repository. If you are planning to distribute the code, make sure to keep the source code public to comply with our [AGPLv3 license](https://dub.sh/license).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dubinc/dub.git
```

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Delete the `apps/docs` directory since it's not needed for self-hosting:

```bash
rm -rf apps/docs
```

Delete the `apps/web/vercel.json` file since cron jobs are not required for the self-hosted version:

```bash
rm apps/web/vercel.json
```

Convert the `.env.example` file to `.env`. You can start filling in the first few environment variables:

```bash
# The domain that your app will be hosted on
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=
# The short domain that your app will be using (could be the same as the above)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN=
# The ID of the Vercel team that your app will be deployed to: https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team#find-your-team-id
TEAM_ID_VERCEL=
# The unique access token for your Vercel account: https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token
AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN=
```

You will fill in the remaining environment variables in the following steps.

## Step 2: Publish Tinybird endpoints

Next, you'll need to publish the Tinybird endpoints:

1. In your [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co/) account, create a new Workspace.
2. Copy your `admin` [Auth Token](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/auth-tokens.html). Paste this token as the `TINYBIRD_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.
3. In your cloned Dub repo, navigate to the `packages/tinybird` directory.
4. Install the Tinybird CLI with `pip install tinybird-cli` (requires Python >= 3.8).
5. Run `tb auth` and paste your `admin` Auth Token.
6. Run `tb push` to publish the datasource and endpoints in the `packages/tinybird` directory. You should see the following output (truncated for brevity):

```bash
$ tb push

** Processing ./datasources/click_events.datasource
** Processing ./endpoints/clicks.pipe
...
** Building dependencies
** Running 'click_events'
** 'click_events' created
** Running 'device'
** => Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
** Token device_endpoint_read_8888 not found, creating one
** => Test endpoint with:
** $ curl https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json?token=p.ey...NWeaoTLM
** 'device' created
...
```

## Step 3: Set up Upstash Redis database

Next, you'll need to set up the Upstash Redis database:

1. In your [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/), create a new database.
2. For better performance & read times, we recommend setting up a global database with several read regions.

![Upstash Redis database](/images/upstash-create-db.png)

3. Once your database is created, copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from the **REST API** section into your `.env` file.

![Upstash Redis tokens](/images/upstash-redis-tokens.png)

4. Navigate to the [QStash tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the `QSTASH_TOKEN`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Request Builder** section into your `.env` file.

![Upstash QStash tokens](/images/upstash-qstash-tokens.png)

## Step 4: Set up Planetscale database

In your [Planetscale account](https://app.planetscale.com/), create a new database. You can use the free tier for this project.

Once your database is created, you'll be prompted to select your language or Framework. Select **Prisma**.

![Planetscale choose framework](/images/planetscale-choose-framework.png)

Then, you'll have to create a new password for your database. Once the password is created, scroll down to the **Add credentials to .env** section and copy the `DATABASE_URL` into your `.env` file.

![Planetscale add credentials](/images/planetscale-add-credentials.png)

Going back to your terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Then, create the database tables with the following command:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

## Step 5: Set up Resend

Next, you'll need to set up Resend for transactional emails (e.g. magic link emails):

1. In your [Resend account](https://resend.com/overview), create a new API key.

![Resend API key](/images/resend-api-key.png)

2. Copy the API key into your `.env` file as the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. You'll then need to set up MX records for your domain to start working. You can follow this guide to learn [how to set up MX records with Resend](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction).

## Step 6: Set up Cloudinary & Unsplash (optional)

If you want to enable the [Custom Social Media Cards](https://vercl.co/help/article/how-to-create-link#custom-social-media-cards) feature, you'll need to set up Cloudinary and Unsplash:

- [How to set up `CLOUDINARY_URL` env var](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_quickstart#set_your_api_environment_variable)
- [How to set up `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` env var](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account)

## Step 7: Deploy to Vercel

Once you've set up all of the above services, you can now deploy your app to Vercel:

1. If you haven't already, push up your cloned repository to GitHub.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

2. In your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/), create a new project.
3. Select your GitHub repository and click **Import**.
4. In the **Environment Variables** section, add all of the environment variables from your `.env` file by copying all of them and pasting it into the first input field. A few notes:
   - Remove the `PROJECT_ID_VERCEL` environment variable for now since we will only get the project ID after deploying the project.
   - Replace the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable with the app domain that you will be using (e.g. `https://app.yourdomain.com`).
5. Click **Deploy**.
6. Once the project deploys, [retrieve your Vercel project ID](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#project-id) and add it as the `PROJECT_ID_VERCEL` environment variable – both in your `.env` file and in your newly created Vercel project's settings (under **Settings** > **Environment Variables**).
7. Add both the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN` as domains in your Vercel project's settings (under **Settings** > **Domains**). You can follow this guide to learn [how to set up a custom domain on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain).
8. Go back to the **Deployments** page and redeploy your project.
9. Visit your app domain (e.g. `https://app.yourdomain.com`) and, voila, you should see the following login page:

## Caveats

This guide is meant to be a starting point for self-hosting vercl.co. It currently depends on the following services to work:

- [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) for the analytics database
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for the Redis database
- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) for the MySQL database
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting & [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware)

In the future, we plan to make it easier to self-host vercl.co by making these dependencies optional by swapping them out for native databases (e.g. mysql, redis, clickhouse, [GeoLite2](https://github.com/GitSquared/node-geolite2-redist) etc.)

Also, Docker is currently not supported, but we have a few [open](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/25) [issues](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/378) and [PRs](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/pull/391) for it.
